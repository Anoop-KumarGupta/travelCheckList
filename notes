states: internal data own by component
-> component memory
props: external data owned by parent component
-> like functional parameters

=>steps:
components
static layout
state
data flow

=>fundamentals of state management in react
state M: deciding when to create a pieces of state, what types of state are necessary, where to place each piece of state,
and how data flows through the app
Types of state:
)local state and global state- context api and redux
)when and where to store data
derive state and ref
lift state up to first common parent

=> controlled elements
piece of state
use value
update value (usually we do with onChange) : now we are done with controlled elements as they are the controller now

In react we cannot mutate items, react is all about immutability

=> derived state: that is computed from existing piece of state or from props

=> two types of exports in javaScript: named export in which we have to use the exact name and second is default export
and in react we usually use default export

=>conditional rendering

=> child props: making a reusable buttons
